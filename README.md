# RedeNetImoveis-Scraping-WebCrawler

In this repository I devoloped a simple web crawler that is able to scrap data from the <a href=https://www.netimoveis.com> Rede Net Imoveis </a> portal. I did it in order to get data for my <a href=https://github.com/gpass0s/Graduation_Project/tree/master> gradutation project </a> which is basically a data analysis of Belo Horizonte housing market prices. 

This code basically interacts with the JSON object that is requested by the site API when a search is made. In order to obtain this JSON object you have to find out on your broswer XHR section which endpoint is hit by the search. For my spefic case the endpoint is this one: https://www.netimoveis.com/venda/minas-gerais/belo-horizonte/apartamento/?pagina=1
