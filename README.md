# RedeNetImoveis-Scraping-WebCrawler

In this repository I devoloped a simple web crawler that is able to scrap data from the <a href=https://www.netimoveis.com> Rede Net Imoveis </a> portal. I did it in order to get data for my <a href=https://github.com/gpass0s/Graduation_Project/tree/master> gradutation project </a> which is basically a data analysis of Belo Horizonte housing market prices. 

This code basically interacts with the JSON object that is requested by the site API when a search is made. In order to obtain this JSON object you have to inspect on your broswer the requests made during a serach in the portal. For my spefic case the JSON object looks something like <a href=https://www.netimoveis.com/venda/minas-gerais/belo-horizonte/apartamento/?pagina=1> this </a>.
